Everyone is a community manager, even those in the community
	- Each person can contribute and influence
	- Take opportunities to teach others (mentor)
	- When you build a community of mentors, you build
	  a community that cares (and sustains)

Co-design is agency
	- let the community influence it's own design
	- user research and workshops
	- it allows people to change their community

Celebrate the moment
	- don't just let the story happen, tell it

Teach consructive feedback
	- how do you give actionable feedback
	- it's tough to really articulate their responses
	- get a structure for type/goal of feedback

Fight for your community (aka be authentic)
... and give back
