Community Building Workshop
	- Carol Smith @fossygrl

Practice and Time are keys
	- imposter syndrome is really tough for everyone
	- nobody can really tell you how to build the community

> Building a healthy sustainable community
	- Three aspects:
	1. how they're set up
		- code of conduct
		- standards of behavior
		- have an understanding of norms
		- documentation and public artifacts
		- communication channels for events
		- have a getting started guide.
		- what's the application process?
	2. The way it grows
	3. Dealing with successes and problems


Three aspects of being a great community leader
	1. public persona

	3. contributions to the community
