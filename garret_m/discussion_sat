	- Scaling has benefits, pitfalls.
	- scaling up, scaling down, and everything inbetween

Why scale down?
	- large events (800+) face logistical contraints
	- sponsorship can be tough to grow
		+ uncertainty breeds risk for them

** Determine what size you want to achieve **
	- gives you goals for everything from venue to sponsorships

Which sponsors want smaller?
	- looking at individual hacks is hard
	- less personal relations between sponsors/hackers
	- build relationships with 5-10

Why scale?
	- proving worth to comp sci dept
	- atrition can be hard
	- only hack in our area
	- community building in the area

	How can big hackathons help smaller ones get attendance

** Horizontal scaling idea: teach a friend to code day **
