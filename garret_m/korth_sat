The first modern hackathon
	- Evan Korth

Original goals of the hackathon:
	- break stereotypes of what building software was
	- teach college students how to use tools not in the classroom
	- create an ecosystem of people who are making things

Leverage existing organizations to bring people in.
	- use your hackathon community for other oportunities

* Strengthening communities between universities
* Building bonds between people building things
