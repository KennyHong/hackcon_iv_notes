MLH Hacker Survey

10k+ responses

Hacker survey takeaways:

1. Fundamentals:
	- hackathons feel stale for organizers
	- BUT, 57% are first timers
	- and most only go to one event per season
	So, what do hackers value??
		- Drinks, snacks, food (pay attention)
		- Opening & closing ceremonies
		* What aspects to they like??
		- 0-300 is the prefered size
		* Yo, stay small if you want.
	People care about the basics. 
2. Inclusivity:
	- 15.7% of CS and 24% of participants identify as female
	- MLH events mirror larger scale demos
	- 10% increase in female hackers since 2013
	So, what can we do??
		- Women tend to like smaller events
		- applications can select out
		- reach to students outside of CS & EE
		* Hmm, I wonder what the best way to do that is??
		- Imposter syndrome disporportionately deters women
		  from attending
		> Don't emmphasize competition/prizes
