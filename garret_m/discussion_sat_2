Sustainably scaling your hackathon
	- why choose the scale you have

Larger hackathon was too impersonal, lost sight of initial goals

Why changes size?
	- companies vs. administration
	- natural growth upwards
	- core team left (going down)

Limiting factors: 
	- venue. having a type of venue can be important
	- budget

How can smaller hackathons serve the community?
	- focus outreach and community service
	- have open demos
	- travel to other events

What about scaling horizontally?
	- more impact for more hackathons, not necessarily bigger
	- give hackathons with different themes or events
