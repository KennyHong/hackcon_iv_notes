# Hackcon IV Notes
----

## What
---
At Hackcon III, I took notes throughout the conference with thoughts, comments, insights from each talk. I'm doing the same thing this year, but with more collaboration. I want to try and collect notes from anyone who wants to contribute so we can have a collection of perpectives and knowledge of the conference.
